"""
forge.py — CLI wrapper running the full pipeline outside an agent harness.

Inside an agent harness, read SKILL.md and drive the stages with the agent's
own tools; the critique and benchmark stages are materially better with real
reasoning behind them. This CLI exists so the repo is useful to everyone else.

Pipeline: ingest -> draft -> critique -> humanize -> (benchmark) -> pack

Works with Anthropic by default, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint via
FORGE_BASE_URL (OpenRouter, Nous, Together, Groq, vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio).
Trend benchmarking needs a browsing agent and is not implemented here.

Usage:
    python3 forge.py --source episode.txt --voice voice-profiles/naga.yaml
    python3 forge.py --source notes.md --platforms linkedin,x --out pack.json
    python3 forge.py --source article.txt --no-humanize --json

- Em dashes and en dashes must not appear in the final text. Restructure the
